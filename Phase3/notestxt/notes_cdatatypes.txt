Data types define the type of data a variable can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.

Data types in C are categorised in three groups: Built-in, user-defined and Derived.
data types in c

Built in data types
char: For characters. Size 1 byte.

char ch = 'A';
int: For integers. Size 2 bytes.


int num = 100;
float: For single precision floating point. Size 4 bytes.

float num = 123.78987;
double: For double precision floating point. Size 8 bytes.

double num = 10098.98899;
bool: For booleans, true or false.

bool b = true;
wchar_t: Wide Character. This should be avoided because its size is implementation defined and not reliable.

User-defined data types
We have three types of user-defined data types in C
1. struct
2. union
3. enum

For now just remember that these comes under user-defined data types.

Derived data types in C
We have three types of derived-defined data types in C
1. Array
2. Function
3. Pointer
